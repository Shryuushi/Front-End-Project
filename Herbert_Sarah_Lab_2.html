        <p>
            Ukiyo-e is a genre of Japanese Art which flourished fromf the 17th through the 19th centuries.
            Its artists produced woodblock prints and paintings of such subjects as female beauties; kabuki
            actors and sumo wrestlers from history; scenes from history and folk tales; travel scenes and 
            landscapes; flora and fauna; and erotica. The term ukiyo-e translates as "pictures of the 
            floating world".

            Typical subjects were female beauties, kabuki actors and landscapes. The women depicted 
            were often courtesans and geisha at leisure, and promoted the entertainments to be 
            found in pleasure districts. Portraits of celebrities were much in demand, in particular
            those from the kabuki and sumo worlds, two of the most popular entertainments of the era.
            While landscapes have come to define ukiyo-e for many Westerners, landscapes flourished 
            relatively late in the ukiyo-e's history.

            Early ukiyo-e were referred to as sumizuri-e (black ink prints) and were 
            printed on washi paper with sumi (black ink). 
            People began to want prints with color so tan, a pigment made from sulfur
            and mercury, was used to paint colors onto the prints. These were called tan-e.
            In the eighteenth century, these were joined by beni-e, which used a pigment
            extracted from safflowers, and urushi-e, which used black lacquer. 
            <br>
            By the mid-eighteenth century, artisans were able to make up two- and three-color prints.
            The appearance of the benizuri-e was a major breakthrough. Following on from benizuri-e,
            Suzuki Harunobu (1725-1770) started to create multicolored woodblock prints called nishiki-e.
